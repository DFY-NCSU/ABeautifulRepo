# ABeautifulRepo: Homework 4

Welcome to the repository for **Homework 4** of the DFY-NCSU project. This repository contains solutions and resources for completing the assigned homework tasks. Below, you will find details about the structure of the repository, how to set it up, and instructions for running the code.


## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of solutions required for Homework 4.

## Key Features

The key feature in this work is that We will use command line tools to facilitate data processing. The process of cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data into more usable formats for analysis or reporting. Often, this data needs to be progressively broken down into different shapes and forms at different stages in order to end up as meaningful information. Data processing allows us to break down complex data processing tasks into subtasks, use off-the-shelf tools to perform these subtasks, and seamlessly integrate the subtasks into the final synthesized information.

## Directory Structure
